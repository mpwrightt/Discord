# 🌱 How to Buy Seeds Guide

## 💡 **Quick Answer:**

**Seeds are automatically purchased when you plant them!**

Use `/grow-start strain:StrainName` and the Buds are deducted automatically.

---

## 📖 **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Get Some Buds**

Before you can buy seeds, you need Buds (the in-game currency):

```
/daily        # Claim 50-100 Buds (once per day)
/weekly       # Claim 250 Buds (once per week)
/balance      # Check your Buds
```

**Starting out?** New users get some Buds automatically!

---

### **Step 2: Choose a Strain**

Use `/grow-start` and the autocomplete will show available strains:

```
/grow-start strain:[start typing...]
```

The autocomplete shows:
- Strain name
- Rarity level
- Cost in Buds

---

### **Step 3: Plant It (This Buys the Seed)**

```
/grow-start strain:Northern Lights
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Bot checks if you have enough Buds
- ✅ Deducts seed cost automatically (50 Buds for Northern Lights)
- ✅ Plants the seed
- ✅ Shows you plant info and grow time

**The seed is now planted and growing!**
