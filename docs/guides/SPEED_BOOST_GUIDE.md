# ‚ö° Speed Boost System Guide

Complete guide to the grow time reduction system with permanent upgrades and consumable items.

---

## üöÄ Overview

There are **two ways** to speed up your plants:

1. **Advanced Hydroponics** - Permanent upgrade (-3 days on ALL plants forever)
2. **Growth Booster** - Consumable item (-1 day on ONE specific plant)

Both can be stacked together for maximum speed!

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Advanced Hydroponics** (Permanent)

### What It Does:
- **-3 days** off ALL future plant grow times
- Permanent upgrade (buy once, works forever)
- Applies automatically when you plant seeds
- Works on all rarity levels

### Cost:
**1,500 Buds**

### How to Buy:
```
/shop                              # See all items
/buy item:advanced-hydroponics     # Purchase for 1,500 Buds
```

### How It Works:
**Automatic!** No commands needed.

When you have Advanced Hydroponics:
1. Plant a seed with `/grow-start`
2. Bot automatically reduces grow time by 3 days
3. Shows reduced time in the confirmation message

### Examples:

**Without Advanced Hydroponics:**
```
Northern Lights (Common):     5 days ‚Üí 5 days
Blue Dream (Uncommon):        7 days ‚Üí 7 days
Girl Scout Cookies (Rare):    10 days ‚Üí 10 days
Gorilla Glue (Epic):          12 days ‚Üí 12 days
Pineapple Express (Legendary): 14 days ‚Üí 14 days
```

**With Advanced Hydroponics:**
```
Northern Lights (Common):     5 days ‚Üí 2 days (-60%!)
Blue Dream (Uncommon):        7 days ‚Üí 4 days (-43%)
Girl Scout Cookies (Rare):    10 days ‚Üí 7 days (-30%)
Gorilla Glue (Epic):          12 days ‚Üí 9 days (-25%)
Pineapple Express (Legendary): 14 days ‚Üí 11 days (-21%)
```

### ROI (Return on Investment):

**Investment:** 1,500 Buds  
**Time saved per plant:** 3 days  
**Benefit:** Faster harvests = more Buds/day

**Example:**
- Normal: Harvest every 7 days = ~10 harvests/month
- With Hydroponics: Harvest every 4 days = ~15 harvests/month
- **50% more production!**

## üíä **Growth Booster** (Consumable)

### What It Does:
- **-1 day** off ONE specific plant
- One-time use consumable (disappears after use)
- Apply to any active growing plant
- Can buy multiple and stack uses

### Cost:
**100 Buds per booster**

### How to Buy:
```
/shop                         # See all items
/buy item:growth-booster      # Purchase for 100 Buds
```

You can buy multiple boosters. They stack in your inventory:
```
/buy item:growth-booster      # Buy 1st
/buy item:growth-booster      # Buy 2nd
/buy item:growth-booster      # Buy 3rd
# Now you have 3 boosters!
```

### How to Use:
```
/grow-boost
```

**What happens:**
1. Bot checks your booster inventory
2. Shows your active plants
3. Applies booster to your plant (currently first plant)
4. Reduces grow time by 1 day
5. Removes 1 booster from inventory

### When to Use Growth Boosters:

**Best times:**
- ‚è∞ Plant is 2-3 days from harvest (push it to harvest faster)
- üíé Legendary strain taking forever (expensive to grow)
- üéØ Need Buds urgently (speed up to sell faster)
- ‚ö° Stack with Advanced Hydroponics for max speed

**Not worth it:**
- ‚ùå Plant is ready in <12 hours (it's already fast enough)
- ‚ùå Common strains (grow time already short)

### Examples:

**Using Growth Booster:**
```
Your plant: Gorilla Glue (Epic)
Days remaining: 5 days
After booster: 4 days (-1 day)
Boosters left: 2
```

**Multiple uses on same plant:**
```
Plant: Pineapple Express (Legendary, 14 days)
Start: 14 days remaining

Use booster #1: 14 ‚Üí 13 days
Use booster #2: 13 ‚Üí 12 days  
Use booster #3: 12 ‚Üí 11 days

Total reduction: -3 days
Cost: 300 Buds (3x boosters)
```

---

## üéØ **Stacking Both Upgrades**

You can combine Advanced Hydroponics + Growth Boosters for MAXIMUM SPEED!

### Example: Legendary Strain Speed Run

**Without any upgrades:**
```
Pineapple Express
Grow time: 14 days
```

**With Advanced Hydroponics:**
```
Pineapple Express
Grow time: 14 ‚Üí 11 days (-3 days permanent)
```

**With Hydroponics + 3 Growth Boosters:**
```
Pineapple Express
Base: 14 days
Hydroponics: -3 days = 11 days
Growth Booster #1: -1 day = 10 days
Growth Booster #2: -1 day = 9 days
Growth Booster #3: -1 day = 8 days

Final: 8 days (43% faster!)
```

## ‚úÖ **Commands Summary**

### Buying Items:
```
/shop                              # View all speed items
/buy item:advanced-hydroponics     # Buy permanent (-3 days)

/grow-boost                        # Use 1 growth booster on active plant
/grow-check                        # See remaining time (with reductions applied)
```

## üí° **Pro Tips**

### 1. **Buy Hydroponics Early**
The sooner you buy it, the more harvests benefit from it!

### 2. **Save Growth Boosters for Expensive Strains**
Using boosters on commons (5 day grow) isn't worth 100 Buds.  
Use them on epics/legendaries (12-14 day grows).

### 3. **Stack for Speed Runs**
Want to harvest a legendary in 1 week instead of 2 weeks?  
Hydroponics (-3) + 3 Growth Boosters (-3) = -6 days total!

### 4. **Time Your Boosts**
Apply boosters 2-3 days before harvest for immediate gratification.  
Don't use them right when you plant - wait a bit!

### 5. **Calculate ROI**
Hydroponics costs 1,500 Buds but saves ~3 days per plant.  
If you harvest every 10 days ‚Üí 3 harvests/month  
With hydroponics (7 days) ‚Üí 4 harvests/month  
Extra harvest = ~400+ Buds  
Pays for itself in 4 months!

## ‚ùì **FAQ**

**Q: Do speed boosts affect yield?**  
A: No! You get the same grams, just faster.

**Q: Can I use multiple Growth Boosters on one plant?**  
A: Yes! Use `/grow-boost` multiple times (costs 1 booster each time).

**Q: Does Advanced Hydroponics apply to plants already growing?**  
A: No, only to NEW plants started after you buy it.

**Q: Can grow time go below 1 day?**  
A: No, minimum is 1 day. The code prevents it from going to 0 or negative.

**Q: Do boosters expire?**  
A: No! They stay in your inventory forever until you use them.

**Q: Can I gift/trade boosters?**  
A: Not yet, but that's a great idea for future updates!
