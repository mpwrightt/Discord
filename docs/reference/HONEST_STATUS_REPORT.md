## ❌ **REMOVED FROM SHOP**

I removed these items because they weren't implemented:
- ❌ Name Color (not possible without role system)
- ❌ Profile Theme (would require custom bot theming)
- ❌ Custom Emoji (Discord permission issues)
- ❌ 2x XP Boost (no XP boost system implemented)
- ❌ 2x Buds Boost (no boost tracking implemented)

**Why removed?** Better to show only working items than disappoint users!

---

## 🧪 **COMPLETE TEST SCENARIO**

Here's a full test to verify everything works:

```
Day 1:
- /daily → Get 50 Buds (total: 150)
- /grow-start strain:Northern Lights → -50 Buds (total: 100)
- /grow-check → See your plant

Day 2-6:
- /daily each day → +50-75 Buds (streak bonuses)
- /grow-water each day → Plant stays healthy
- /grow-check → Watch progress

Day 7:
- /daily → +75 Buds
- /grow-harvest → Get 60g buds (based on health)
- /sell grams:60 → +180 Buds (60 × 3 Buds/g)

Total after 1 week: ~500 Buds profit

With 500 Buds:
- /buy item:extra-slot → -500 Buds, now can grow 3 plants
- Next week: 3 harvests = 540 Buds income
- Profit triples!

After 3 weeks:
- /buy item:nutrients-pack → -400 Buds
- Harvests now give 69g instead of 60g (+15%)
- /sell 69g → 207 Buds (+27 Buds per harvest)

After 5 weeks:
- /buy item:better-lights → -800 Buds
- Harvests now give 77g (60 × 1.15 × 1.10)
- /sell 77g → 231 Buds
- Upgrades pay for themselves!

After 2 months:
- Saved 5,000 Buds
- /buy item:master-grower → Get purple role!
```

## 💯 **DATA PERSISTENCE**

Everything persists across bot restarts:
- ✅ User Buds balances
- ✅ Growing plants (position, health, watering time)
- ✅ Purchased equipment
- ✅ Daily/weekly claim timestamps
- ✅ Birthday bonuses claimed
- ✅ XP and levels
- ✅ All statistics (grams grown, sold, etc.)

**Tested:** Restart bot → Data still there!

---

## 🎨 **IMAGE GENERATION STATUS**

**Commands exist but show "not available":**
- `/generate` - Built, needs Google Imagen 3 API
- `/strain-art` - Built, needs Google Imagen 3 API

**Why?** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (your AI model) doesn't generate images. You'd need:
- Google Imagen 3 API (separate service, requires application)
- OR DALL-E API (OpenAI, costs money)
- OR Stable Diffusion API (various providers)

**Current behavior:** Commands work, return friendly "not available yet" message.

- They can play games for rewards
- They can buy upgrades that actually work
- Everything saves properly

Minor items that need work:
