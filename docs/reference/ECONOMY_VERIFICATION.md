- ✅ **`/grow-feed`** - Deducts 15 Buds & boosts yield (+15%)
- ✅ **`/grow-harvest`** - Adds grams to your stash in database

**How:** `/grow-start` checks your equipment and allows 3 plants
**Test:** Buy it, then start 3 plants!

### **💡 Better Grow Lights (800 Buds)**
**Effect:** +10% yield on ALL harvests permanently
**How:** `/grow-harvest` checks your equipment and applies boost
**Test:** Harvest with and without - you'll get 10% more grams!

## 💾 **DATA PERSISTENCE**

Everything persists across bot restarts:
- ✅ User Buds balances
- ✅ Growing plants (health, progress, watering)
- ✅ Purchased items in inventory
- ✅ Daily/weekly claim timestamps
- ✅ Birthday bonuses
- ✅ XP and levels
- ✅ All statistics

**Test:** 
1. Check `/balance`
2. Restart bot
3. Check `/balance` again - same data!

## 🔄 **COMPLETE ECONOMY LOOPS**

### **Loop 1: Daily Grower**
```
Day 1: /daily (50 Buds) → /grow-start (‑50) → 0 Buds
Day 2: /daily (50) → /grow-water → 50 Buds
Day 3: /daily (55) → /grow-water → 105 Buds
Day 4: /daily (60) → /grow-water → 165 Buds
Day 5: /daily (65) → /grow-water → 230 Buds
Day 6: /daily (70) → /grow-water → 300 Buds
Day 7: /daily (75) → /grow-harvest (70g) → /sell (210 Buds) → 585 Buds!

Result: 585 Buds profit in 7 days
```

### **Loop 2: Upgraded Grower**
```
Week 1: Earn 585 Buds (as above)
Week 2: /buy nutrients-pack (‑400) → Now 185 Buds
        Grow & harvest with +15% → Get 81g instead of 70g
        /sell 81g → 243 Buds → 428 Buds total
Week 3: /buy better-lights (‑800) → Now have both
        Grow & harvest with +25% → Get 91g
        /sell 91g → 273 Buds
        
With upgrades: 273 Buds per harvest vs 210 = 63 Buds more!
Upgrades paid off in 13 harvests (13 weeks)
```

### **Loop 3: Scale Up**
```
Month 1: Earn ~2,000 Buds
Month 2: /buy extra-slot → Grow 3 plants at once
         Triple your income!
         3 harvests × 273 Buds = 819 Buds per week
Month 3: ~3,276 Buds per month
         Can now buy VIP roles, more upgrades, etc.

## ⚠️ **WHAT DOESN'T WORK YET**

### **Auto-Water System**
- ✅ Saves to inventory
- ❌ Doesn't prevent health loss automatically (yet)
- **Workaround:** Manual /grow-water still works
- **Future:** Will auto-water plants

### **Roles (VIP, Connoisseur, Master Grower)**
- ✅ Saves to inventory
- ❌ Doesn't auto-assign Discord role
- **Workaround:** Manually assign roles in Discord
- **Future:** Bot will auto-assign roles

### **Image Generation**
- ✅ Commands work
- ❌ Returns "not available" message
- **Reason:** Needs Google Imagen 3 API (separate service)
- **Future:** Add when you get Imagen API access
